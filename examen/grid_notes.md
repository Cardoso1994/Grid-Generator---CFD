Continuity equation

Infinitesimally small elem moving
    fxd mss
    shape, vol, change
    dm = rho dv (mass, dens, volume)
    time rate mass zero, subs deriv of mass with time


## All equations are one
4 equations, state the same, different forms
    integral, diff, conservation, non-
can be obtaine from one to the other by manipulation

integral -> differential
